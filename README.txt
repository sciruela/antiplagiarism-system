His Program has been implemented: 

*PHP Simple HTML DOM parse
http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/

*HTML5 Upload Example

*PHP File Upload example
http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_file_upload.asp

*Read a PDF File
http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html


The main idea is to read the content of the PDF file. The program read each line, which are separated by '.'. Then it ask to Google using the sentence between double comma "This is a proof" and it get the results. If there is a similar sentence the program understands that the sentenced was copied, otherwise if the sentence does not match up with any the program understands that the sentences is original. Finally it calculates a plagiarism rate <copied_sentences>/<total_sentences>.
